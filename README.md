# ESSS Kraken Macros

Kraken is a reservoir data management tool that natively reads and interprets data from Schlumberger’s ECLIPSE 100/300, 
CMG’s IMEX, STARS and GEM, UTCHEM, and several other simulators. For more information, visit www.kraken.com.br

Kraken allows the creation of scriptable macros to easily create custom process to your reservoir data or extend 
the application features. This repo contains some macros created by the support team, freely available for all Kraken 
users:

 - [Declice Curve Analysis](src/macros/dca): macro for production predictions using decline curves 
 - [Material Balance](src/macros/mbal): macro for analyitical calculation of material balance
